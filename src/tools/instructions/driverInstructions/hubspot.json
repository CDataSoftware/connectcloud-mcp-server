  "instructions": {
    "overview": "HubSpot driver provides access to HubSpot CRM data through the REST API. It supports querying contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and custom objects with HubSpot's property-based data model.",
    "dataModel": {
      "hierarchy": "Portal → Objects → Records → Properties. Core objects include contacts, companies, deals, tickets, products. Custom objects follow similar patterns.",
      "keyTables": [
        "contacts",
        "companies",
        "deals",
        "tickets",
        "products",
        "line_items",
        "quotes",
        "calls",
        "emails",
        "meetings"
      ],
      "relationships": "contacts associate with companies. deals associate with contacts and companies. tickets can be associated with contacts and companies. line_items relate to deals and products."
    },
    "queryPatterns": {
      "timeFiltering": "Use createdate, lastmodifieddate, or hs_lastmodifieddate with timestamp format. Example: WHERE createdate >= '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'.",
      "commonQueries": [
        "SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE lifecyclestage = 'customer'",
        "SELECT * FROM deals WHERE dealstage = 'closedwon' AND createdate >= '2024-01-01'",
        "SELECT * FROM companies WHERE industry = 'technology'",
        "SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE hs_ticket_priority = 'HIGH' AND createdate >= '2024-01-01'"
      ],
      "bestPractices": [
        "Use property names exactly as defined in HubSpot",
        "Filter by lifecycle stages and deal stages for meaningful data",
        "Include appropriate date ranges for performance",
        "Use association queries for related objects",
        "Be aware of API rate limits and property limits"
      ]
    },
    "fieldConventions": {
      "userFields": "hubspot_owner_id references HubSpot users. hs_created_by and hs_updated_by track record changes.",
      "dateFields": "createdate, lastmodifieddate, hs_lastmodifieddate use timestamp format. Custom date properties follow HubSpot naming conventions.",
      "idFields": "hs_object_id is the primary key. Association IDs link related objects."
    },
    "limitations": [
      "API rate limits apply (100 requests per 10 seconds for most endpoints)",
      "Property limits exist for custom properties",
      "Some historical data may not be available",
      "Complex multi-object queries may require multiple API calls",
      "Batch operations have size limits"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "Rate limit exceeded: Implement proper throttling and retry logic",
      "Invalid property: Verify property names match HubSpot configuration",
      "Authentication errors: Check API key permissions and scopes",
      "Performance issues: Use appropriate filters and pagination",
      "Missing associations: Verify object relationships are properly configured"
    ]
