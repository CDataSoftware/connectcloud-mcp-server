    "overview": "QuickBooks driver provides access to QuickBooks Online and Desktop data through the QuickBooks API. It supports querying accounting entities like customers, vendors, items, transactions with accounting-specific relationships.",
    "dataModel": {
      "hierarchy": "Company → Entities → Transactions → Line Items. Core entities include customers, vendors, items, accounts, employees. Transactions include invoices, bills, payments, purchases.",
      "keyTables": [
        "customers",
        "vendors",
        "items",
        "accounts",

        "payments",
        "purchases",
        "estimates"
      ],
      "relationships": "invoices relate to customers. bills relate to vendors. line items relate to items and accounts. payments relate to invoices or bills. estimates can be converted to invoices."
    },
    "queryPatterns": {
      "timeFiltering": "Use MetaData.CreateTime, MetaData.LastUpdatedTime, or TxnDate with ISO format. Example: WHERE MetaData.CreateTime >= '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'.",
      "commonQueries": [
        "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE Active = true",
        "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE TxnDate >= '2024-01-01' AND Balance > 0",
        "SELECT * FROM items WHERE Active = true AND Type = 'Inventory'",
        "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE AccountType = 'Income'"
      ],
      "bestPractices": [
        "Filter by Active = true for current records",
        "Use appropriate date ranges with TxnDate or MetaData fields",
        "Include account types for meaningful account queries",
        "Use customer/vendor references for transaction queries",
        "Be aware of QuickBooks API rate limits and sync token requirements"

    "fieldConventions": {
      "userFields": "CreatedBy, ModifiedBy may reference employees or users depending on context.",
      "dateFields": "MetaData.CreateTime, MetaData.LastUpdatedTime use ISO format. TxnDate uses YYYY-MM-DD format.",
      "idFields": "Id is the primary key (string). Foreign keys reference related entities (CustomerId, VendorId, ItemId)."
    },
    "limitations": [
      "QuickBooks API has specific rate limits and throttling",
      "Some operations require sync tokens for data consistency",
      "Complex multi-entity queries may require multiple API calls",
      "Historical data access depends on QuickBooks version and subscription",
      "Some fields are read-only and cannot be modified"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "Rate limit exceeded: Implement proper throttling and retry logic",
      "Authentication errors: Verify OAuth tokens and company ID",
      "Sync token errors: Refresh tokens and handle concurrent access",
      "Permission denied: Check QuickBooks user permissions and app scope",
      "Data inconsistency: Use appropriate filters and handle deleted records"
