    "overview": "Generic best practices for working with CData drivers. These guidelines apply to most CData drivers and provide a foundation for effective data querying and management.",
    "dataModel": {
      "hierarchy": "Most CData drivers organize data in a hierarchical structure: Connection → Catalog → Schema → Table → Columns. The specific hierarchy depends on the data source.",
      "keyTables": [
        "Use getCatalogs() to discover available connections",
        "Use getSchemas() to discover available schemas",
        "Use getTables() to discover available tables",
        "Use getColumns() to discover table structure"
      ],
      "relationships": "Use getExportedKeys() and getImportedKeys() to discover foreign key relationships between tables. This helps understand data connections and enables proper joins."
    },
    "queryPatterns": {
      "timeFiltering": "Most drivers support standard SQL date functions. Use ISO 8601 format for date literals: 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'. Check driver documentation for specific date functions.",
      "commonQueries": [
        "SELECT * FROM [TableName] LIMIT 100",
        "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [TableName]",
        "SELECT * FROM [TableName] WHERE [DateField] >= '2024-01-01'",
        "SELECT * FROM [TableName] ORDER BY [DateField] DESC LIMIT 10"
      ],
      "bestPractices": [
        "Always start with small result sets using LIMIT clause",
        "Use specific column names instead of SELECT * for better performance",
        "Apply filters early in the query to reduce data transfer",
        "Use proper indexing hints when available",
        "Test queries with small datasets before running on large tables"
      ]
    },
    "fieldConventions": {
      "userFields": "Common user field patterns include: CreatedBy, ModifiedBy, Owner, AssignedTo. Field names vary by data source.",
      "dateFields": "Common date field patterns include: CreatedDate, ModifiedDate, LastUpdated, Timestamp. Use getColumns() to identify date field types.",
      "idFields": "Primary keys are typically named 'Id', 'ID', or '[TableName]Id'. Foreign keys often follow '[ReferencedTable]Id' pattern."
    },
    "limitations": [
      "API rate limits may apply - check specific driver documentation",
      "Some data sources have query complexity restrictions",
      "Large result sets may require pagination using LIMIT and OFFSET",
      "Not all SQL functions are supported by every driver",
      "Connection timeouts may occur with long-running queries"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "Connection errors: Verify credentials and network connectivity",
      "Query syntax errors: Check driver-specific SQL dialect support",
      "Performance issues: Add appropriate filters and use LIMIT clause",
      "Permission errors: Verify user has necessary access rights",
      "Timeout errors: Break large queries into smaller batches"
    ]
