    "overview": "ServiceNow driver provides access to ServiceNow platform data through the REST API. It supports querying tables, records, and relationships with ServiceNow's query syntax and field conventions.",
    "dataModel": {
      "hierarchy": "Instance → Application → Table → Records → Fields. Core tables include incident, problem, change_request, cmdb_ci, sys_user. Most tables extend from sys_metadata.",
      "keyTables": [
        "incident",
        "problem",
        "change_request",
        "cmdb_ci",
        "sys_user",
        "sys_user_group",
        "task",
        "kb_knowledge",
        "cmdb_rel_ci",
        "sys_audit"
      ],
      "relationships": "incident extends task table. problem and change_request also extend task. cmdb_ci is central for configuration items. sys_user relates to many tables via assigned_to, opened_by, closed_by fields."
    },
    "queryPatterns": {
      "timeFiltering": "Use sys_created_on, sys_updated_on, or date fields with 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format. Example: WHERE sys_created_on >= '2024-01-01 00:00:00'.",
      "commonQueries": [
        "SELECT * FROM incident WHERE state = 1 AND active = true",
        "SELECT * FROM cmdb_ci WHERE operational_status = 1",
        "SELECT * FROM change_request WHERE state = -5 AND start_date >= '2024-01-01'",
        "SELECT * FROM sys_user WHERE active = true AND user_name LIKE '%@company.com%'"
      ],
      "bestPractices": [
        "Always filter by active = true for current records",
        "Use state field for workflow status filtering",
        "Include sys_id field for unique identification",
        "Use appropriate date ranges with sys_created_on/sys_updated_on",
        "Be aware of ACL (Access Control List) restrictions"
      ]
    },
    "fieldConventions": {
      "userFields": "opened_by, assigned_to, closed_by reference sys_user table. Use sys_user.user_name for email addresses.",
      "dateFields": "sys_created_on, sys_updated_on, opened_at, closed_at use 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format in instance timezone.",
      "idFields": "sys_id is the primary key (32-character string). Foreign keys reference sys_id of related tables."
    },
    "limitations": [
      "ACL restrictions may limit data access based on user roles",
      "Some system tables require elevated permissions",
      "Complex queries may hit performance limits",
      "Historical data retention depends on instance configuration",
      "API rate limits apply to concurrent requests"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "Access denied: Check user roles and ACL permissions",
      "Invalid table: Verify table exists and is accessible",
      "Performance issues: Add appropriate filters and avoid complex joins",
      "Authentication errors: Verify credentials and account status",
      "Rate limiting: Implement proper throttling and retry logic"
    ]
