  "instructions": {
    "overview": "Jira driver provides access to Atlassian Jira data through the REST API. It supports querying issues, projects, users, and workflows with JQL (Jira Query Language) compatible syntax.",
    "dataModel": {
      "hierarchy": "Instance → Project → Issue → Fields/Comments/Attachments. Core entities include issues, projects, users, workflows, components, versions.",
      "keyTables": [
        "issues",
        "projects",
        "users",
        "workflows",
        "components",

        "comments",
        "attachments",
        "worklog",
        "issuetypes"
      ],
      "relationships": "issues belong to projects. issues have assignee and reporter (users). issues can have components and affect versions. comments and worklogs belong to issues."
    },
    "queryPatterns": {
      "timeFiltering": "Use created, updated, or resolutiondate with ISO format. Example: WHERE created >= '2024-01-01' OR updated >= '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'.",
      "commonQueries": [
        "SELECT * FROM issues WHERE project = 'PROJ' AND status = 'Open'",
        "SELECT * FROM issues WHERE assignee = 'user@company.com' AND resolution IS NULL",
        "SELECT * FROM issues WHERE issuetype = 'Bug' AND priority = 'High'",
        "SELECT * FROM issues WHERE project = 'PROJ' AND created >= '2024-01-01'"
      ],
      "bestPractices": [
        "Always filter by project for better performance",
        "Use issue keys (PROJ-123) for specific issue queries",
        "Filter by status or resolution for meaningful subsets",
        "Include appropriate date ranges with created/updated",
        "Use JQL-compatible syntax for complex queries"
      ]
    },
    "fieldConventions": {
      "userFields": "assignee, reporter, creator reference user accounts. Use email or username for identification.",
      "dateFields": "created, updated, resolutiondate use ISO 8601 format. Custom date fields follow Jira naming conventions.",
      "idFields": "id is the primary key (integer). key is the human-readable identifier (PROJECT-123). Foreign keys reference related objects."
    },
    "limitations": [
      "JQL syntax has specific requirements and limitations",
      "Complex queries may require multiple API calls",
      "Custom fields have dynamic names based on configuration",
      "Some fields require specific permissions to access",
      "API rate limits and concurrent request limits apply"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "Invalid JQL syntax: Review Atlassian JQL documentation",
      "Permission denied: Check user permissions for projects and fields",
      "Performance issues: Add project filters and use appropriate indexes",
      "Authentication errors: Verify credentials and API token permissions",
      "Rate limiting: Implement proper throttling and retry mechanisms"
    ]
